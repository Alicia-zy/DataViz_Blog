Main title shows data from 2019 to 2020, but the graph plots data from 2019 till 2021.It will create confusion among readers. Main title also does not indicate that the merchandise trade was between Singapore and its top 6 trading countries between 2019 to 2020.\n\n\nThe graph does not have any subtitle to describe the information or provide any insight derived from it.\nx-axis label does not match with its values. x-axis label is Month of Period, but x-axis values are years, i.e. 20219,2020 and 2021.\nScales in y axis for Export and Import are different. For example, in the first pane of Hong Kong, monthly Export values range from 0-6M while monthly Import values are only between 0-800K. Such plot may mislead readers and give them the wrong perception of the actual merchandise trade volumes.\n\n1.2 Aesthetic\nThe main title at the top is not in line with the main graph and country/region names in each pane is not in line with individual graph.\nThere’s overlap between Export and Import. The mixture of colors makes the the graph a bit blur and not easy to differentiate between the two variables.\nx-axis labels Month of Period is not necessary as it’s time series and should be self explanatory.\nAnnotations are not used to convey points, leaving the reader to interprete the purpose of the graph. Lack of information source, indication of currency and unit.\n2 Alternative Design\nThe proposed design is as follows. \n2.1 Clarity\nTitle and subtitle are added to explain the purpose and major findings of the visualization. Only data in 2019 and 2020 is selected and avoid conflicts between title and graph. Instead of looking at monthly merchandise trade, the new visualization will look at data in quarterly level. The aggregated data can give readers clearer perspectives on the seasonal changes between two years and provide them meaningful insights.\nExport and import are separated into two sections vertically. Scales of the two are set to be the same. Therefore, comparison between export and import can be conducted directly and clearly. Meanwhile, each country/region’s data is divided into two parts based on the year. So it’s easier to compare quartely trend changes between two years.\nx-axis values are changed to four quarters which corresponding to the title.\n2.2 Aesthetic\nChart Title and country/region names are aligned with the main graph and individual graphs.Six country/region are sorted in descending order based on the sum of export and import values.\nExport and import are separated into two sections and coulor is used to differentiate different categories, i.e. country/region.\nx-axis labels are removed.\nAnnotations are added to provide detailed analysis on individual country/region and missing information like source and currency.\n3 Proposed Visualization\nPlease view the interactive visualisation on Tableau Public here.\n4 Step-by-step Guide\n4.1 Data Cleaning using Tableau Prep Builder\n4.1.1 Download data from DOS website\nEnter DOS website with the link and click Download all in Excel under Merchandise Trade by Region/Market\n\n4.1.2 Loading data into Tableau Prep Builder\nOpen Tableau Prep Builder and use it to do the data preparation.\nOpen Finder and locate the data file.

Rename field to Country.\nRepeat the above steps, change first to last. Edit value to Thousand Dollars and rename field to currency.\n\n\n4.1.6 Pivot data\nClick + on Clean 1 step and choose Pivot.\nChange to Show List View.Select 24 months Fields and drag to Pivot Values.\n\n4.1.7 Convert pivot values from thousand dollars to dollars\nClick … on the Pivot1 Values. Choose Custom Calculation.\nFill in formulas.\n\n4.1.8 Change Field Currency to Type\nClick Group Values under Currency Manual Selection. Change field value Thousand dollars to Import.\nChange Field Name from Currency to Type.\n\n4.1.9 Clean second working sheet T2 and combine 2 tables\nRepeat the above steps and clean T2.\nDrag T1 to T2 and choose Union. Create a new table called Union 1.\nRemove new field Table Names.\n\n4.1.10 Create output\nClick + on the Union 1 step and choose Output.\n4.1.11 Run flow and save file\nChange the file name to Singapore trade_2019-2020_clean.\nClick Run Flow and save the file.\n\n4.2 Data Visualization using Tableau Desktop\n4.2.1 Load cleaned data file into Tableau Desktop\nOpen Tableau Desktop and drag the cleaned data file into the working pane\n\n4.2.2 Draw skeleton plot\nDrag Country into Columns.\nDrag Date into Columns and date become years.

Add data source, currency and notes.\n\n\n5 Derived Insights\nMy proposed design is as below: \n1. Singapore Merchandise export with 6 major trading parterners\nCompared to 2019, Singapore’s yearly merchandise export to 6 countries/regions generally remain the same or slightly increased except for to Malaysia. It’s consistent with the overall export growth rate 4.3% despite the Covid pandemic in 2020 and one of the drivers is the persistent global demand for semiconductors and pharmaceuticals (KENTARO IWAMOTO, 2021). For the largest export destionation China, export value declined in the first two quarters while it increased rapidly from Q3 onwards. It’s projected to keep the increase trend in 2021 given its good control of covid 19 and progressive vaccination program. It needs to get Singapore’s government and cooperates more attention. Singapore also experienced increased demand from United States in 2020. However, the demand decreased slightly in Q4 2020 compared to previous quarter though it’s still higher than the same period in 2019. It maybe related to the worsening covid situation in America and more research can be conducted to investigate the change.\nSingapore exports grow in 2020 despite COVID turmoil\nSingapore’s Top Trading Partners\n2. Singapore Merchandise import with 6 major trading parterners\nCompared with export, Singapore’s yearly import remains relatively stable in 2020. Though there’s some fluctuations over the quarters in some countries. It’s quite alarming that import from United States dropped significantly and the decreasing trend could probably continue in 2021. Besides that, import from neighbouring country Malaysia declined a lot in Q2. The main reason could be Malaysian Movement Control Order (MCO) 1.0 implemented from 18 March to 3 May 2020. It led to a hit to Malaysian’s economy. Singaporean government should monitor Malaysia’s export regulations&policies closely as Singapore relies heavily to it.It’s vital to keep a secure supply chain of food and other resources. Government needs to review its current import strategies and diversitify its import sources.\nWiki:Malaysian movement control order\n3. Trade with Taiwan\nTaiwan is the only region experienced growth in both export and import among 6 listed countries/regions.Taiwan has became one of the most important sources of import and the yearly import value has reached more than 40B singapore dollars. Singapore and Taiwan signed a free trade agreement including removing custom duties to deepen bilateral trade in 2013. Both parties shall work more closely to find out potential trading opportunties.\nEconomic Partnership Agreement Between Singapore and Taiwan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
