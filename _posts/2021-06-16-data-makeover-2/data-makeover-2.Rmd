# 1. Critique of Visualisation
The original visualisation is created by using the same data for makeover 1 and is provided by Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS). The data are available under the sub-section of [Merchandise Trade by Region/Market.](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data)

![](Image/Figure 1 Original Visualization.png){height="1000"}

### 1.1 Clarity
1. **Titles:** This visualisation does not contain title and provide any information about the data like what this data set is about. 

2. **Label of trade values** 
    + Though it states in the note that the size of the bubble reflects the total merchandise trade value with the trading partner, we don't know the period of the aggregated trade volume and if it's monthly, quarterly or yearly data. We can only infer it's data in year 2020 when refering it to the original data.

    + As each bubble takes up some space, it does not correspond to the x-axis and y-axis clearly like points. Readers cannot tell the exact volume of import and export.    

    + There're some overlaps between bubbles. The bubbles of some trading partners like EU, United States and Republic of korea are blocked by neighbouring bubbles.Therefore, readers are not able to see the white circle and which area it falls into. There's no way to tell whether those countries belong to net importers or net exporters.   

3. **Y-Axis and X-Axis** There's no indication of unit and currency in the x-axis and y-axis. 

4. **Information box** The insights in the information box compare data since 2006 and show the change point of net trade volume of Mainland China with Singapore and Unites States with Singapore separately. However, it does not match with the static graph which only presents one year's data. 

### 1.2 Aesthetic
1. **Colors** The graph used more than 10 colors. Colors are used to differentitate trading partners and do not encode values. Colors don't reflect any differences between trading partners and should be minimized. 

2. **Data Ink** Data ink are used in the graph. There're some unnecssary data ink like light blue backgroud color outside the chart and should be removed to emphasize the rest data ink. Same for the information box. For such findings or insights, creator could emphasize it through putting on the subtitles or annotations in the graph.

3. **Lengend** The legend of Top Net Exporter and Top Net Importer is placed at the bottom of the graph. Readers could not immediately understand the meaning of the two icons without scrolling down to the bottom part. 

4. **Annotation** Annotation with the trading partners and total trade values are too big and block bubbles representing the total trading values. 

# 2. Alternative Design
My proposed design is as follows.
![](Image/Figure 2.jpeg){width=80%}

### 2.1 Clarity
1.  **Titles:**  Add interactive title with parameter top trading partners and filter year. When reader select certain year and the number of top trading partners they want to look at, title will update automatically to match with the data retrievd. 

2. **Label of trade values** 
    + Adding the year in the title and readers can see immediately from the title to know the periods of data. 
    
    + By adding total trade value, net trade value, imports and exports in the tooltip, readers can read all information in details when they hover on the bubble.
    
     + Using transparency and border color and avoid one bubble obscures the other. Use two color diverging scheme, readers can tell if it's a net exporter(blue) or net importer(red) from the color. They can also know the trade balance value from the darkness of the color. The darker the color, the larger the net trade balance. 

3. **Y-Axis and X-Axis** Add singapore dollars in the x and y axis.

4. **Information box** By adding slopgraph and comparing the change between 2011 and 2020. We can see the change from the graph and numbers directly. 

### 2.2 Aesthetic
1. **Colors**  Use only two colors to represent measures in each graph and each color represent different meaning. Red represents net importer and blue represents net exporter. 

2. **Data Ink** Remove background colors and unnecssary color inks. 

3. **Lengend** Shift the legend to the right top corner and make it more visible and easier to readers. 

4. **Annotation** Adding annotation in the subtitles and use colors to highlight important messages.

# 5. Derived Insights
1. **Mainland China** China has increased 33.9% from 2011 to 2020 in terms of total trade value with 35.9% increase in imports and 32% increase in exports. If playing the animations, it can be found that it has always been net exporter in blue color for 10 years. Net trade balance dropped to the lowest point S$1 Billion which is grey in year 2018. It exceeded Malaysia and became the top 1 trading partner in 2013.Though the total trade value increased positively, the growth rate ranks only number 3 and it's lower than United States(35%) and Taiwan(64.6%).

2.**Hongkong** has been top 1 net exporter since 2011 and exports value kept in the range between 55 billions and 65 billions Singapore dollars which is relatively stable. It has replaced Indonesia and became the second largest trading partner Singapore exporting to. 

3. **Taiwan** Taiwan's trade with Singapore has grown exponentially in the past 10 year and has been the top 1 net importer in 2020. The total trade value increased 64.6% and imports increased 83.1% which is the highest among all trading partners. 

4. **Indonesia and Malaysia** Indonesia and Malaysia used to be among top 3 net exporters with Singapore. However, both exports values droppped significantly with 48.1% and 28.4% respectively. Malaysia has change from net exporter to net importer since 2019. 
![](Image/Figure 5.4.png){width=80%}

5. **United States** United States has also experienced fast growth in trade with Singapore with 35% increase in total trade value. It catched up with European Union and exceeded EU in 2019. What's interesting is the net trade balance in 2020 which exports exceeded imports. Before 2020, United States has always been a net exporter.
